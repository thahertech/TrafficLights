# TrafficLights


This project was made from the request of a friend. 
---------------------------------------------------
Problem :

 A friend of mine uses a machine to slice wood in his garage.
 The machine requires 2 people to operate it.
 One side of the machine has an input and the other side is the Output.
 Neither side is visible to one-another and loud sounds created by the machine 
 blocks any chance of signaling by voice.
 
Solution : 

 We create a software specification document that lists 
 all the required aspects and properties of the final product. 
 With the help of this I created a plan of how to
 complete this in the easiest & most efficient possible way.
 Using C++, Arduino Uno, a button, 4 leds and 20 meters of jumpwires I was able to put this project together.


 Software enables you to switch the
 status of the LED lights using a button.
 Switch is between Red and Green leds.
